# Home Assistant Community Add-on: Z-Wave JS to MQTT

The Z-Wave JS to MQTT add-on allows you to decouple your Z-Wave network from
your Home Assistant instance by leveraging your MQTT broker. It ships with
a web-based control panel, allowing you to configure every aspect of your
Z-Wave network and how they are published in MQTT.

Some advantages and use-cases for this are:

- Compatible with the Home Assistant Z-Wave JS integration.
- Your Z-Wave network will keep running between Home Assistant restarts.
- You can directly use things like Node-RED with your Z-Wave network, while
  it is available for Home Assistant at the same time.
- Allow [ESPHome.io][esphome] based ESP devices to directly respond or work
  with your Z-Wave network.

This add-on uses the [Zwavejs2Mqtt][zwavejs2mqtt] software.

## Installation

The installation of this add-on is pretty straightforward and not different in
comparison to installing any other Home Assistant add-on.

1. Search for the "Z-Wave JS to MQTT" add-on in the Supervisor add-on store
   and install it.
1. Start the "Z-Wave JS to MQTT" add-on.
1. Check the logs of the "Z-Wave JS to MQTT" add-on to see if everything went
   well.
1. Click the "OPEN WEB UI" button.
1. Enjoy the add-on!

**NOTE**: The upstream project has documentation on using the software itself:
<https://zwave-js.github.io/zwavejs2mqtt/#/>

## Configuration

**Note**: _Remember to restart the add-on when the configuration is changed._

Example add-on configuration:

```yaml
log_level: info
```

### Option: `log_level`

The `log_level` option controls the level of log output by the addon and can
be changed to be more or less verbose, which might be useful when you are
dealing with an unknown issue. Possible values are:

- `trace`: Show every detail, like all called internal functions.
- `debug`: Shows detailed debug information.
- `info`: Normal (usually) interesting events.
- `warning`: Exceptional occurrences that are not errors.
- `error`: Runtime errors that do not require immediate action.
- `fatal`: Something went terribly wrong. Add-on becomes unusable.

Please note that each level automatically includes log messages from a
more severe level, e.g., `debug` also shows `info` messages. By default,
the `log_level` is set to `info`, which is the recommended setting unless
you are troubleshooting.

## Known issues and limitations

- None at this point.
