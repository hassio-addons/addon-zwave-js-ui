# Home Assistant Community Add-on: Z-Wave JS to MQTT

The Z-Wave JS to MQTT add-on allows you to decouple your Z-Wave network from
your Home Assistant instance by leveraging your MQTT broker. It ships with
a web-based control panel, allowing you to configure every aspect of your
Z-Wave network and how they are published in MQTT.

**Note**: Unlike the title of the software suggests, you don't need to
use MQTT part (it is even disabled by default). It will work directly
without MQTT using the Home Assistant integration. The add-on will provide
a nice secondairy and extensive Z-Wave JS control interface in such cases.

Some advantages and use-cases:

- Compatible with the Home Assistant Z-Wave JS integration.
- Your Z-Wave network will keep running between Home Assistant restarts.
- You can directly use things like Node-RED with your Z-Wave network, while
  it is available for Home Assistant at the same time.
- Allow [ESPHome.io][esphome] based ESP devices to directly respond or work
  with your Z-Wave network.
- Pre-configures itself with the Mosquitto add-on when found.

This add-on uses the [Zwavejs2Mqtt][zwavejs2mqtt] software.

## Installation

The installation of this add-on is pretty straightforward and not different in
comparison to installing any other Home Assistant add-on.

1. Click the Home Assistant My button below to open the add-on on your Home
   Assistant instance.

   [![Open this add-on in your Home Assistant instance.][addon-badge]][addon]

1. Click the "Install" button to install the add-on.
1. Check the logs of the "Z-Wave JS to MQTT" add-on to see if everything went
   well.
1. Click the "OPEN WEB UI" button.
1. Enjoy the add-on!

**NOTE**: The upstream project has documentation on using the software itself:

## Setting up the Home Assistant Z-Wave JS integration

By default the Home Assistant Z-Wave JS integration will try to set up the
official "Z-Wave JS" add-on from the official add-on store.

**It is recommended to use the official add-on instead of this one!**

However, this add-on will provide an add-on UI and has the ability to
send/receive data over MQTT as well. So, if that is your thing, this
add-on might be for you.

After starting the add-on successfully, it is time to hook it up with
Home Assistant.

To do this:

1. Open the Z-Wave JS to MQTT control panel by clikcing the "OPEN WEB UI"
   button on the add-on page in the Supervisor.
1. In the control panel, go to "Settings" in the menu and click on the "Zwave"
   bar that shows up on the right.
1. Enter the following information:
   - Serial Port (e.g., `/dev/serial/by-id/usb-0658_0200_if00`)
   - Network Key (e.g., `2232666D100F795E5BB17F0A1BB7A146`)

Now click the "SAVE" button and navigate to the "Control Panel" in the menu.
If you had devices paired already, you should see the showing up slowly.

Now it is time to set up Home Assistant:

1. Go to the Configuration panel and click "Integrations".
1. In the bottom left, click "+ Add Integration".
1. Select the "Z-Wave JS" integration from the list.
1. A dialog box will show, asking to use the add-on:
   - **UNCHECK** that box, it will install the officia add-on.
   - Again, the official add-on is recommended, so...
1. In the next dialog it will ask for the server. Enter:
   `ws://a0d7b954-zwavejs2mqtt:3000`
1. Confirm and done!

## Configuration

**Note**: _Remember to restart the add-on when the configuration is changed._

Example add-on configuration:

```yaml
log_level: info
```

### Option: `log_level`

The `log_level` option controls the level of log output by the addon and can
be changed to be more or less verbose, which might be useful when you are
dealing with an unknown issue. Possible values are:

- `trace`: Show every detail, like all called internal functions.
- `debug`: Shows detailed debug information.
- `info`: Normal (usually) interesting events.
- `warning`: Exceptional occurrences that are not errors.
- `error`: Runtime errors that do not require immediate action.
- `fatal`: Something went terribly wrong. Add-on becomes unusable.

Please note that each level automatically includes log messages from a
more severe level, e.g., `debug` also shows `info` messages. By default,
the `log_level` is set to `info`, which is the recommended setting unless
you are troubleshooting.

## Known issues and limitations

- Z-Wave JS to MQTT supports Home Assistant Discovery over MQTT. It is
  **STRONGLY** recommended **NOT** to use that option. Use the Z-Wave JS
  integration as documented above instead.
